# Processing Sequences
A deep dive into sequence processing methods and it's applications.
## Introduction 

To model sequences, we need :
1. Handle Variable-length sequences
2. Track long-term dependencies
3. Maintain information about the order
4. Share parameteres across sequences
 
## Recurrent Neural Networks
Recurrent neural network looks very much like a feedforward neural network, except it also has connections pointing backward
